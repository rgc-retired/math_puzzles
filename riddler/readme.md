## Birthday

This is an investigation into the generalized birthday problem.  The
classic problem asks the question: How many people are needed in a room
before the probability exceeds 50% that two or more people have the
same birthday?  This problem is actually quite easy with an answer of 23.
The more difficult problem asks: How many people are needed in a room
before the probability exceeds 50% that M or more people have the same
birthday?  Even for M=3 this is difficult.


## Coffee Cards

A fun little problem.  Assume you have two coffee cards that can purchase
up to 50 cups of coffee.  Each day you randomly pick a card and use it.
One day the barrista tells you your card is used up.  What is the expected
number of cups still remaining on the other card?
