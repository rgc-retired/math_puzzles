<p>From Michael Branicky, your card has been declined:</p>
<p>Lucky you! You’ve won two gift cards, each loaded with 50 free drinks from your favorite coffee shop, Riddler Caffei-Nation. The cards look identical, and because you’re not one for record-keeping, you randomly pick one of the cards to pay with each time you get a drink. One day, the clerk tells you that he can’t accept the card you presented to him because it doesn’t have any drink credits left on it.</p>
<p>What is the probability that the other card still has free drinks on it? How many free drinks can you expect are still available?</p>
<h1 id="solution-to-last-weeks-riddler-classic"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic</h1>
<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-times-a-day-is-a-broken-clock-right/">Solution Website</a></p>
<p>Last week, lucky you had won two gift cards to your favorite coffee shop, Riddler Caffei-Nation. The cards looked identical and each was initially loaded with 50 free drinks. You were interested more in the drinks and less in record keeping, so each time you redeemed a beverage you simply presented the cashier with one of the cards at random. One sad and fateful day, however, the cashier told you he couldn’t accept the card you presented him because it was out of drinks. What was the probability that the other card still had free drinks on it? How many free drinks could you expect were still available?</p>
<p>Praise the Coffee Gods, there was a 92 percent chance that your other card was still valid, containing at least one drink credit. What’s more, you could expect that there were about seven drinks left on that card.</p>
<p>So how do we get to those answers? Suppose, for the sake of generality, that each card started with n drinks. What we want to know are how many drinks, k (which could be anything from zero to n), remain on the other card when one card zeros out.</p>
<p>Call the cards A and B. As solver Jason Ash explained, there are two possibilities: 1) Card A runs out of drinks first and Card B has k drinks remaining or 2) Card B runs out of drinks first and Card A has k drinks remaining. Since the cards are identical and we pick which to use randomly, these outcomes are equally likely, so we only need to analyze one of them, and then we can double the probabilities that result from that analysis.</p>
<p>So suppose it is A that runs out and there are k drinks left on B. For this to happen, Jason explained, we must have purchased n drinks on the first card, n-k drinks on the second card and attempted one more purchase on the first card, for a total number of visits to the coffee counter of 2n-k+1 . Of those purchases, n must have occurred on a single card. This suggests an “X choose Y” binomial formula. Specifically, the chances of there being k drinks left on Card B are:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{2n-k}\choose{n}} (1/2) ^ {2n-k+1}\]</span></p>
<p>We then multiply this by two - to account for the fact that it might have been Card B that exhausted first.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{{2n-k}\choose{n}} (1/2) ^ {2n-k}\]</span></p>
<p>If we plug in 50 for n and zero for k , we find the chance that both cards are actually exhausted - that chance is about 8 percent, so the chance that the other card does have at least a coffee left is about 92 percent - our first answer.</p>
<p>To find the expected value of the number of coffees that remain on the other card (k), we can sum the expression above by all of the coffee possibilities. Specifically,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \sum _{k=0} ^{k=n} {k {{2n-k}\choose{n}} (1/2) ^ {2n-k}} \]</span></p>
<p>Plug in n=50 and that equals just over seven, our second answer. And we’re done.</p>
<h1 id="analytic-solution"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Analytic Solution</h1>
<p>This appears to be an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#Probability_mass_function">binomial distribution</a> of getting 50 hits on one card with 50-k hits on the other. This is a total total population of 100-k drinks. If there are k drinks remaining on one card when all 50 drinks are used on the other card, then the probability can be written as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P = {{100-k}\choose{50}} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) ^ {100-k}\]</span></p>
<p>Where the binomial coefficient is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{N\choose{K}} = \frac{N!}{(N-K)! K!}\]</span></p>
<p>The binomial coefficient defines the number of different ways the 50 drinks on the card are distributed. The second term expresses the probability of picking a particular card. Regardless of the distribution, there is a 50% chance of either card on each trial. Note that I have not identified either card as the one that is used up – so there is no need to double the end result as done above on FiveThirtyEight.</p>
<p>For values of k from 0 (no drinks remaining) on up, the probability is calculated as:</p>

<p>The mean result is 7.038512976105055 drinks remaining.</p>
<p>Note that for Monte-Carlo simulation it will be difficult to reach the rare events (e.g. more than 40 drinks remaining). Even with 1e6 trials there is a less than 7% chance of reaching 40.</p>
