[Part 1](https://www.r-bloggers.com/reversi-in-r-part-1-bare-bones/)

Simple text-like version of reversi.  This does not actually play the game.
It is simply an implementation of the game board.

This is a single R file.

I modified the name of the file to remove spaces and modified the
play.game() function to turn off the bell for mouse selections.


[Part 2](https://www.r-bloggers.com/reversi-in-r-part-2-graphics-and-custom-boards/)

Prettier Graphical version of the original along with some bug fixes.

** This requires plotrix (which I had to install) **

This is a ZIP file that explodes into a R file and supporting TXT files.

I modified the name of the R file to remove spaces.
I made one fix to the source file for a syntax error on line 10.

I changed the logic to get rid of the audible bell on each mouse click.
I changed the logic to display legal moves in red instead of gray.
