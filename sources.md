# Other Puzzle Sources

There are a large number of excellent puzzle resources available
on-line and in print.  Among the best are:

[The Bent of Tau Beta Pi](https://www.tbp.org/pubs/brainTicklers.cfm)

    Four times a year the Engineering honor society publishes a new
    issue.  Each issue contains seven excellent puzzles.  Solutions
    are published in the subsequent issue.  The Bent archives of
    Brain Ticklers extend back to 2000.

    These puzzles are generally among the best found anywhere.

[The Riddler of 538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/)

    Each time puzzles are added to the Riddler there are two
    new opportunities to find bliss.  As each new puzzle set
    is published, the solutions to the previous puzzle set is
    provided.

    New puzzles are published every one or two weeks.

    many other puzzles as well.
