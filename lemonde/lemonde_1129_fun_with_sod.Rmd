## Le Monde 1129: Fun with Sum of Digits

[Xi'an Website](https://xianblog.wordpress.com/2020/02/10/le-monde-puzzle-1129/)

The problem is repeated below:

    When the three consecutive numbers 110, 111 and 112, they all are multiples
    of the sum of their digits. Are there 4 consecutive numbers with three digits
    like this? A contrario, does there exist 17 consecutive numbers with three
    digits such that they cannot be divided by the sum of their digits? 18?



```{r}
library(gtools)

bez=!(100:999)%%apply(baseOf(100:999),1,sum)
(100:897)[bez[-(1:3)]*bez[-c(1:2,900)]*bez[-c(1,899:900)]*bez[-(898:900)]==1]
```

and for the other problem:

```{r}
max(diff((1:899)[!!diff(bez)]))
```
