# Problems from Tau Beta Pi

The files in this directory reproduce problems and solutions published
in the Brain Ticklers column from the Bent of Tau Beta Pi.

The original sources are the PDF files located at the website for
[The Bent of Tau Beta Pi](https://www.tbp.org/pubs/brainTicklers.cfm)


File names have the following form:

    solution_yyyy_n.Rmd = R markdown source for use in RStudio
    solution_yyyy_n.html = rendered solution from the Rmd + support files

Where:

    yyyy = year
    n = 0, 1, 2, 3 for Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall

The figures are contained in `*.png`.

Support files are of type .R, .lua, .py, and .txt.  Some are referenced
in the Rmd files and some are just left over from my musings.

About 2/3 of the problems have solutions.
