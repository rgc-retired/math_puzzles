The minimum feasible game would be 10/11 moves.  A
move can not be blocked until a saucer contains two
other marbles.  The minimum configuration occurs
after 10 marbles have been placed.

We label the marbles as n_{i} and n_{i+1} with the
constraint that n_{i+1} > n_{i} and n1-n10 map
(somehow) to the integers 1-10:

	Saucer 1: n1 n2
	Saucer 2: n3 n4
	Saucer 3: n5 n6
	Saucer 4: n7 n8
	Saucer 5: n9 n10

When going to place m=11 this would be blocked under
the following case:

	11-n2 = n2-n1
	11-n4 = n4-n3
	11-n6 = n6-n5
	11-n8 = n8-n7
	11-n10 = n10-n9

So, the question is whether or not this has solutions
with integers 1-10 mapped to n1-n10.  The answer is no.

One of the larger marbles in the saucers must be number 10.
This defines the partner as 9.  The pair is 10,9.

Of the remaining 4 saucers, one of the larger marbles must
be 8.  This defines the partner as 5.  The pair is 8,5

Of the remaining 3 saucers we have 7,3

Of the remaining 2 saucers we have 6,1

The final saucer has 4,2 which would allow marble 11.

Conclude: you can always place 11 marbles.

What about 12 marbles?  We have the five saucers as:

	Saucer 1: n1 n2
	Saucer 2: n3 n4
	Saucer 3: n5 n6
	Saucer 4: n7 n8
	Saucer 5: n9 n10 n11

When we go to place marble=12 we will be blocked if:

	12-n2 = n2-n1
	12-n4 = n4-n3
	12-n6 = n6-n5
	12-n8 = n8-n7

	12-n11 = n11-n10 or n10-n9 or n11-n9
		or
	12-n10 =            n10-n9 or n11-n9

To know if this can be solved we need to know where
marble=11 is located.  If it is at one of the saucers
with only two marbles then that immediately defines
the partner (as above).  If marble=11 is located in
saucer 5 then we require n11=11 and:

	12-n11 = 1 --> n10=10 or n10-n9=1 for a block

	if n10==10 then n9<9
	if n10<10 then n9=n10-1

Sort of stuck here ...
